        <p>Starting off this Biography of mine, let’s talk about my childhood and the stories and experiences that I can remember, at 
            the very least.<sup>1</sup> Of course, it all starts with my birth, on July 29, 2005, I was born.<sup>2</sup> Funny story 
            actually, from what I heard from my mother, when I was being delivered, I was putting up more of a fight than the doctors 
            thought.<sup>3</sup> I will now add here that the doctors told my mom I was a “big boy” which meant she had to “push” hard.<sup>4</sup> 
            Added context out of the way, apparently, I wanted to burst out of my mom’s chest, which added a lot of strain on my mom.<sup>5</sup> 
            This story that my mom tells me is why I am forever grateful for my mom.<sup>6</sup> Anywho, skipping a few years ahead, 
            3 years to be exact, this was the time that I said my first words.<sup>7</sup> From what I could remember, and from the 
            stories that my mom and dad told me, they were very proud of that moment.<sup>8</sup> They cherish it, even to this day.<sup>9</sup> 
            Moving forward 1 year, this is where I found what is still one of my favorite movies of all time, just because of its special 
            place in my heart.<sup>10</sup> The movie in question is called “Dragon Wars”, one of the very first movies I have been exposed 
            to when I was a kid.<sup>11</sup> Fun fact, I was so in love with this movie when I was a kid that the movie's intro, the whole 
            2 minutes of it, I memorized; all the words, the timings, everything.<sup>12</sup> Throughout my childhood years, nothing 
            “too spectacular” happened.<sup>13</sup> I started school, blasted through my nursery and kindergarten days, passing it 
            with flying colors.<sup>14</sup> I will say though, and I will never forget this moment because the trophy that I got from 
            it is in my room.<sup>15</sup> It was the time I got nominated for a “model” for my nursery school.<sup>16</sup> It was a 
            very fun experience, I got to meet new people, and of course, I got a lot of compliments from people.<sup>17</sup> Now moving 
            on to when I started elementary school, and it was in the month of June, I can’t remember the specific date, but the year 
            was 2011.<sup>18</sup> The school of my choice was the University of the East, due to a lot of factors, the biggest one of 
            them is the fact that my mom works at the University of the East.<sup>19</sup> My days in Elementary here are some of the 
            best memories I have, all the friends, and crushes too, all my teachers, and everything I have experienced here in UE up 
            until I turn to a teenager are still the best memories and I will never forget and will always cherish them.<sup>20</sup></p>

    <div class="section"><h2><b><i>Teenage Years</i></b></h2></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Now for what I can say are the “Happy years” of my life, so to speak at least, are my teenage years.<sup>1</sup> Now I just 
            have to start this off by saying yes, I still go to the University of the East, due to the benefits.<sup>2</sup> Now, onto 
            the story of my teenage years.<sup>3</sup> I’m going to start this off with a sad one.<sup>4</sup> A love interest of mine 
            “broke up” with me, and it was all my fault.<sup>5</sup> I promised from then on that I will treat everyone that I meet, be 
            it man or woman, I will treat them with the respect they deserve.<sup>6</sup> Now moving onto the better parts of my teenage 
            years.<sup>7</sup> Starting off with me saying that for the first time ever, even in my Elementary days, all of my grades 
            are 90 and above, which granted me a spot in the top 5 in our class, the only other time I did that was way back in Grade 4, 
            but even then I was pushing it, barely getting top 5.<sup>8</sup> It honestly continued like this, me getting really good 
            grades, getting a spot in the top 10 or top 5 of my class, and then getting recognized for it, it felt amazing.<sup>9</sup> 
            Now to switch it up a tiny bit, let’s talk about driving, more specifically me practicing how to drive a motorcycle.<sup>10</sup> 
            Those times where I nearly hit someone or I nearly ran through straight into a ditch were some of the most fun I have had in 
            my teenage years.<sup>11</sup> This also taught me another lesson, that “Practice absolutely makes perfect”.<sup>12</sup> 
            Also in my teenage years, is where I started to think about my life.<sup>13</sup> This is the point in my life where I started 
            to think about the future.<sup>14</sup> Not just my future too, I was also thinking about my friend’s future and my family’s 
            future.<sup>15</sup> That was when I made a promise to myself, a promise that even to this day I keep, 
            “I’ll strive to be the best version of myself, always keeping a positive mental outlook on life.”<sup>16</sup> 
            Making that promise to myself, I set out to make sure to keep that in my mind.<sup>17</sup> Now to wrap things up, my teenage 
            years were honestly the best, hence why I called it my “Happy years”, at least for now, things might change though.<sup>18</sup> 
            After all, this was my teenage years, and a lot can change in a span of a few years.<sup>19</sup> 
            Be it for better or for worse, but I definitely made that it was for the absolute best.<sup>20</sup></p>

    <div class="section"><h2><b><i></i>College Years</i></b></h2></div>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Now to present times, wherein memories are fresh and experiences are yet to come.<sup>1</sup> Welcome to my retelling of my 
            college experience, thus far.<sup>2</sup> My first time stepping into the Lualhati building was so familiar yet so surreal.<sup>3</sup> 
            I say this because, just in case you couldn’t tell, I have been in the University of the East all the way back to Elementary 
            up to College, loyal student, I know.<sup>4</sup> It was so surreal to step into a building that I saw standing tall once, 
            then I saw it burn down to the ground, and then here we are, Lualhati Building standing long and proud.<sup>5</sup> 
            Now as for my first day in college, I won’t lie, I was terrified.<sup>6</sup> I was terrified of the unfamiliarity because 
            everything was so new to me.<sup>7</sup> But then I made my first friend, I won’t name him due to privacy reasons but let’s 
            just say we vibed the first time that we met one another.<sup>8</sup> After making a new friend and even meeting new ones, 
            getting to know my teachers and fellow classmates, my uncertainty turned into curiosity and joy.<sup>9</sup> 
            Curious about the fact of “what does college have to throw in my way?”, and joy because of that realization that I am a 
            college student here in UE.<sup>10</sup> I won’t lie, my 1st year 1st sem as an IT student was lowkey amazing.<sup>11</sup> 
            Of course there were times where college felt like a little too much for my adapting brain, but overall, it was fun, 
            especially my classmates.<sup>12</sup> They made my college life so much better.<sup>13</sup> 
            Now we come to that point in my college life where I can confidently say, was the best semester I had.<sup>14</sup> 
            Here’s my experience in 2nd year 1st semester.<sup>15</sup> I can honestly round up my experience this semester with one 
            word, “Wonderful”, and even that word is an understatement.<sup>16</sup> I got to meet new college friends, and funny enough, 
            old senior highschool classmates/friends as well.<sup>17</sup> All the teachers that I’ve met in my time in college thus far 
            have been amazing.<sup>18</sup> Not only do they teach you the curriculum, but they also teach you stuff about life, they also 
            make sure that every class you have, you’ll walk out of that classroom having fun while at the same time learning something, 
            and for that I am very grateful.<sup>19</sup> Now I can’t really say “wrap up” or “to conclude this” because I’m still in 
            my 2nd year, 2nd sem so I’ll end it with this, I am looking forward to the days following and I am excited as to what the 
            future holds for me.<sup>20</sup>
